# From 688 to Success: My AWS Certification Story

I failed the AWS exam with a score of **688 out of 700**.

Just 12 points short. That number haunted me for days.

I had studied, watched youtube videos and did a few practice questions. I thought I was ready. But the exam was more than just facts, it tested how well I could apply concepts in real scenarios. And I wasn’t prepared for that level of depth.

## What I Did Differently

After the initial disappointment, I regrouped. Here's what changed:

- Better Resources: I leaned into AWS Skill Builder and YouTube walkthroughs. 

- Practice with Intention: I took practise exams, reviewed every wrong answer, and learned the “why” behind each solution.

## The Second Attempt?

I passed. And this time, I didn’t just scrape  through the work but gave my all and as much as one can have doubt, confidence is key.

## Final Thoughts

Failing with 688 was tough. But it taught me that near-success is still a lesson. It pushed me to study smarter, not just harder.

If you're close but not quite there don’t give up. You’re already on the path. Keep going. Your 700 is coming.
