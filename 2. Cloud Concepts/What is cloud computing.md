#  What Is Cloud Computing? 

## Definition

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence over the internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

Instead of owning and maintaining physical data centers and servers, users can access technology services on demand from a cloud provider like AWS.

## Key Characteristics

Cloud computing is defined by several core characteristics:

### 1. **On-Demand Self-Service**
Users can provision computing resources (e.g., servers, storage) automatically without human intervention from the service provider.

### 2. **Broad Network Access**
Resources are accessible over the internet from a wide range of devices (e.g., laptops, smartphones, tablets).

### 3. **Resource Pooling**
Cloud providers use multi-tenancy to serve multiple customers with dynamically allocated resources from a shared pool.

### 4. **Elasticity and Scalability**
Resources can be scaled up or down automatically based on demand. This allows for flexibility and efficient use of resources.

### 5. **Measured Service**
Usage is monitored, controlled, and reported enabling pay-as-you-go pricing models and transparency.



Cloud computing enables organizations to be more agile, reduce costs, and innovate faster. Understanding these characteristics is essential for grasping how AWS and other cloud platforms operate.
