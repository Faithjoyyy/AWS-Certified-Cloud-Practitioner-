# Shared Responsibility Model

AWS and the customer share responsibility for security and compliance.

## AWS Responsibilities (Security *of* the Cloud)
- Physical infrastructure (data centers, hardware)
- Network and virtualization layers
- Managed services (e.g., RDS, S3)

## Customer Responsibilities (Security *in* the Cloud)
- Data encryption and integrity
- Identity and access management
- Application-level security
- Operating system and network configuration (for IaaS)


Example: In EC2, AWS secures the host, but the customer secures the OS and firewall.
