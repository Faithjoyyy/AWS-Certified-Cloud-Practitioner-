# Cloud Deployment & Service Models

Understanding deployment and service models is key to choosing the right cloud strategy.

##  Deployment Models

###  Public Cloud
- Services offered over the internet by third-party providers (e.g., AWS).
- Shared infrastructure, but logically isolated resources.
- Cost-effective and scalable.

###  Private Cloud
- Cloud infrastructure operated solely for one organization.
- Can be hosted on-premises or by a third party.
- Offers greater control and customization.

###  Hybrid Cloud
- Combines public and private clouds.
- Enables data and application portability.
- Ideal for gradual cloud adoption and regulatory compliance.

##  Cloud Service Models

###  IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
- Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
- Examples: Amazon EC2, Amazon VPC.
- Users manage OS, applications, and data.

###  PaaS (Platform as a Service)
- Provides a platform for developers to build and deploy applications.
- Examples: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Lambda.
- Abstracts infrastructure management.

###  SaaS (Software as a Service)
- Delivers software applications over the internet.
- Examples: Amazon WorkMail, AWS Chime.
- Users access software via browser or app; no infrastructure management.
